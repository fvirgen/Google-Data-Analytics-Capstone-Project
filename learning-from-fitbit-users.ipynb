It includes data on the users' daily activity, steps, calories, heart rate, and sleep. All data is stored in CSV files which are easily importable to various analysis tools (Excel, R, SQL, etc.). Although Sršen encouraged the use of other data to perform the analysis, only this dataset was used for this case study. The tools used in this analysis are Google Sheets/Excel and Big Query (SQL). \n\n*Exploring, Verifying and Cleaning the Data*\n\nBefore importing the files into SQL, all columns that had a date and time (e.g. ActivityHour) were formatted to DATE TIME in Google Sheets.

The dashboard can be found [here!](https://public.tableau.com/views/BellabeatCaseStudyLearningfromFitBitUsers/DashboardTrendsinDailySteps?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. It is important to note that this dataset only includes data from 33 participants, with no demographic information. Because of this, we cannot conclude that the results of this analysis can be applied to Bellabeat's target population which is women.\n\n2. To gain a better insight on their users, Bellabeat users should be encouraged to include demographic and health information when setting up their Bellabeat app and device.They should also be highly encouraged to set up their health goals so that the Bellabeat application can be tailored to their needs and likings. These goals and health information (e.g. weight) should be periodically updated so that they can recognize (and celebrate) their achievements and they can create new goals. \n\n3. Fitbit users most popular features are tracking the following: Steps, Activity, and Sleep. For this reason, I am providing recommendations based on my analysis on these health data. These recommendations are tailored to Bellabeat's product 'Ivy' and the Bellabeat App since both these products track this information.\n\n* Steps - Because majority of the Fitbit users did not hit the recommended 10,000-step goal, Bellabeat should ensure that users are aware of how many steps they are taking daily and be encouraged to reach their own step goals. Bellabeat's users should be reminded when their step counts are looking low for the day so that steps can be encouraged. Users can also be rewarded (notified) when increments of their step goal have been reached, which can motivate them to reach their daily goal. \n* Activity - Although majority of the Fitbit users were able to hit the recommended Active minutes, Bellabeat can do better by giving options (through the Bellabeat app) to their users on how they can increase their activity throughout day, tailored to their bodies needs. Suggestions can include how much is the recommended time to do the activity, and the calories burned.\n* Sleep - Even if the data from the Fitbit users was lacking for the most part, it showed that users are interested and somewhat consistent in tracking their sleep data. Fitbit users have an average of 6-7 hours of sleep a night. Bellabeat should encourage their users to also get at least 7 hours of sleep every day. They can do this by setting a bed time and a wake up time so that the time to sleep can be calculated for the user. They can include downtime meditation in their Bellabeat app to help their users fall asleep in a calm and relaxed manner. To gain more insight on their user's sleep, the Bellabeat app can ask for feedback to see how the user felt rested through their sleep. \n\n4. To increase their users, Bellabeat can focus on marketing their Bellabeat app and the features that it can provide to their users:\n\n* Personal and tailored to your needs.\n* Weekly and monthly reporting to track progress and opportunites for improvement in health habits.\n* Adding projection data for their users (i.e. If they are consistent with their good habits, X results can happen).\n* New activities to try to improve health data (e.g. Ideas to increase steps/activity for the day). Partner with other businesses (e.g. Yoga studios) to give users perks or discounts to encourage users to try new activities or to simply get moving. \n","metadata":{}}]}
